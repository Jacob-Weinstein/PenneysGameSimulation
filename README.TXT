For a simulation of Penney's Game. See Wikipedia:
"Penney's game, named after its inventor Walter Penney, is a binary (head/tail) sequence generating game between two players.
Player A selects a sequence of heads and tails (of length 3 or larger), and shows this sequence to player B.
Player B then selects another sequence of heads and tails of the same length.
Subsequently, a fair coin is tossed until either player A's or player B's sequence appears as a consecutive subsequence of the coin toss outcomes.
The player whose sequence appears first wins."
